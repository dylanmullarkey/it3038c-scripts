# Final Project -- Hydro Homie Chrome Extension

## About

Hydro Homie is a chrome extension that allows you to set a goal amount (in fl oz.), as well as the size of your waterbottle, to help hold you accountable for staying hydrated when online.

I often find myself struggling to stay hydrated when working on my computer, as I'm focused on my screen. I created this in hope of having an easier time and way to track how much I drink, to hold myself accountable.

This project is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

## How to Use
The application is fairly simple! Open up the extension, enter a goal amount of fl. oz, and hit the start button! Before starting, make sure to choose the bottle size you have.

Once you've started, use the + and - buttons on the right to add bottles you've drank. Do so until you hit your goal!

You can reset anytime after you start.
