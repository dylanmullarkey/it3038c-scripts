# Final Project -- Hydro Homie Chrome Extension

## About

Hydro Homie is a chrome extension that allows you to set a goal amount (in fl oz.), as well as the size of your waterbottle, to help hold you accountable for staying hydrated when online.

I often find myself struggling to stay hydrated when working on my computer, as I'm focused on my screen. I created this in hope of having an easier time and way to track how much I drink, to hold myself accountable.

This project is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.
